# DeepAffex™ Cloud API

The NuraLogix DeepAffex™ Cloud API (DFX API) is used to analyze the facial
blood-flow information extracted from images by the
[DeepAffex™ Extraction SDK](https://www.deepaffex.ai/developers-sdk/). For an
overview of DeepAffex technologies, please refer to our
[Developers Guide](https://docs.deepaffex.ai/guide/index.html)

The API is organized into groups composed of individual endpoints e.g. General,
Users, Profiles, Measurements etc. are high-level groups of calls while
General.Status is an individual endpoint within the General group.

You may use the following documentation as a reference for interfacing with all
transport types, although REST is assumed as the primary. Note that each service
may have extra facilities available. The current API does not generally limit
access across different transports, so feel free to use the transports
interchangeably.


# 1. Getting Started

The following instructions will provide an overview of how to get started with
DFX API and show how take a Measurement and obtain its results.

Assuming the following prerequisites are met:
* You have a DeepAffex user account and a valid License Key
* Using one of the [DeepAffex Extraction SDKs](https://www.deepaffex.ai/developers-sdk/)
you are able to obtain an encoded payload to send as Measurement data.

Follow these steps to take a test Measurement:

1. Make a request to 
<a href="/#reference/0/organizations/register-license">Register License</a>
endpoint. You only need to do this once per active Device. The response will
contain a Device Token - save it locally. Check the returned `RoleID` of your
License, if it's `SDK_DEVICE`, then Step 3 is mandatory.

2. For all consecutive API requests send the obtained Token with request headers
<a href="/#introduction/3.5.-authentication-headers">for authentication.</a>

3. (Optional) <a href="/#reference/0/users/login">Authenticate as a User.</a>
You will receive a User Token back, which will upgrade the Device Token with
your account information. This will improve measurement traceability down the
road. Replace the Device Token in Step 2 with the newly obtained User Token.

4. <a href="/#reference/0/measurements/create">Create new Measurement,</a> save
the returned Measurement `ID` locally.

5. If you would like to receive results for each sent chunk in real time,
<a href="/#reference/0/measurements/subscribe-to-results">subscribe to results</a>
using a WebSocket connection.

6. Start TOI data extraction using the DeepAffex SDK and obtain a Payload.

7. Once you have collected enough data,
<a href="/#reference/0/measurements/add-data">send a data chunk in.</a>

8. Continue sending chunks until your measurement is complete. Make sure to mark
the last chunk with `LAST::PROCESS` action.

9. <a href="/#reference/0/measurements/retrieve">Retrieve measurement results</a>
using the saved Measurement `ID`.

# 2. WebSocket Transport

The API supports access via WebSockets. This transport method is highly
optimized and provides a fast and efficient method of communicating with DFX
API. We recommend leveraging this transport for platforms that need performance
and real-time response.

In order to open a connection to the WebSocket service an `Authorization` header
must be supplied. Also during connection creation, the string `"json"` needs to
be passed as the WebSocket protocol to the server which indicates to the server
that the client's payloads will be JSON. Upon connecting, all exchanges with the
server must follow a consistent request pattern described below.

Service calls to the WebSocket service use action identifiers and request IDs.
The body of the request has to be JSON with the same structure as the request of
the corresponding REST endpoint with one difference - URL path and query
parameters (discussed below.)

In order to maintain the connection with the server, you must implement proper
ping/pong heartbeats as required by the WebSocket standard specification. Aside
from the standard use of WebSocket connectivity mechanics, the API uses a custom
request/response exchange pattern outlined below.

## 2.1 Authenticating

In order to leverage the socket API, you must establish a connection with the
server, e.g. `wss://api.deepaffex.ai` (if needed, please check with NuraLogix
for the correct URL for your geography). When making the connection a header
should be used that includes:

```
Authorization: Bearer [token]
User-Agent: [name of the device/agent]
```

If the supplied authorization details are incorrect, the connection will be
refused and the socket is dropped by the server. Upon a successful connection
the socket will open and handshakes should be complete, signalling availability
of the service.

Upon connecting to the API we recommend checking the current API version and
general status. This is done by calling the General.Status endpoint which will
respond with the appropriate status details.

## 2.2 Requesting Data

The socket API receives requests and sends them with a structured buffer.
Requests that do not abide by the proper structure are not processed and a
response body with the following structure is returned:

```
{
  Code: "INCORRECT_REQUEST"
}
```

The following identifies the structure of a WebSocket request:

```
Buffer( [ string:4 ][ string:10 ][ string/buffer ] )
```

The first 4 bytes are an Action ID for the request, which maps to the routes
table listed below.

The second 10 bytes are a unique string identifier for the request. The client
is responsible for creating it's own request patterns. This could be a counter
or a randomly generated alphanumeric string ie. `JDUEHDJEKO` or `000000001`. We
encourage using a counted request key to encourage uniqueness of the request.
This request ID is only used within the current connection and does not
interfere with other concurrent connections using the same token. Request
identifiers are not stored, so reusing them is possible however not recommended.

The remaining bytes of the payload represents the full body of your request.
Request body is similar to REST API request body documented for each endpoint.
URL path parameters must be passed via the `"Params"` key in the request
JSON and URL query parameters via the `"Query"` key. Their values should be JSON
objects whose keys are URL path / query parameter names and values are the
corresponding path / query parameter's values.

For example, for the endpoint <a href="/#reference/0/organizations/delete-partner-measurement">`Delete Partner Measurements`</a>
(url: `/organizations/{ID}/partners/{PartnerID}/measurements`):

```
{
    "Params": {
        "ID": "organization_id",
        "PartnerID": "partner_id"
    },
    "Query": {},
}
```

In this example, path parameters `ID` and `PartnerID` are specified in `Params`
and endpoint does not require body parameters.

Another example, for the endpoint <a href="/#reference/0/studies/update">`update study`</a>
(url: `/studies/{ID}`):

```
{
    "Params": {"ID": "study_id"},
    "Query": {},
    "Name": "Study Type Sample",
    "StatusID": "INACTIVE",
    "Description": "New description goes here.",
    "Config": {}
}
```

## 2.3 Receiving Data

The socket API responds to requests with the provided request identifier. The
structure of the response is as follows:

```
Buffer( [ string:10 ][ string:3 ][ string/buffer ] )
```

The first 10 bytes are the request identifier, the second 3 bytes are an HTTP
status identifier and the remaining bytes are the response body as JSON which
is similar to REST API response documented for each endpoint.

When implementing a request/response structure, the client needs to manage
requests in memory and await the servers response. The server will always
respond to a request to close it out, regardless of if there's an error or not.
See the status code table list to identify general errors. The body will also
contain relevant error information.

Note: For some streaming/results services, the API might operate slightly
differently, requiring you to subscribe to a channel/feed by touching an
endpoint/request and receiving data on the same identifier. More details are
provided in the endpoint outline. The WebSocket transport is the only method of
receiving real-time results data for measurements and other feature facilities
while REST support static calls suitable for polling processes.

# 3. Using API Transports

In order to use WebSockets in a similar manner to REST, all method calls are
prefixed by the Library (endpoint groups) followed by a period and the method
in the library. For example `PUT /users` is accessible via `Users.create`.

An important difference in the call methods is translating query string and
parameters that would typically be sent via the REST service to the WebSocket
payloads. As explained earlier in Section 2.2, please use the `"Params"` and
`"Query"` keys in the request. For example, for the `Meta.retrieveByType`
endpoint:

```
{
    "Foo": "bar",
    "Query": {
        "Namespace": "all",
        "Fields": "Foo,Bar"
    },
    "Params": {
        "Type": "Group",
        "ID": "7ab8bee7-808c-4123-9811-e385adb8c77d"
    }
}
```

In essence `Query` and `Params` are values that are extracted from the payload
body and interpreted as values that would typically be expected by a REST
request.

Error messages are transported in turn in similar object formats as listed
below. The WebSocket interface also follow this pattern.

# 3.4. Endpoint Error Codes

All error messages sent down the wire are simple objects with one "error"
property. The value of this property could be the following:

Errors will come back with the following JSON structure. A `code` property will
always be present identifying the generalized error. The `errors` property will
return as an array of object of errors associated and mapped to the type of
error code being sent. In the validation example a breakdown of the fields and
their expected results will be returned.

```
{
    "Code": "VALIDATION",
    "Errors": {
        "FirstName": [
            [
                "STRING_GREATER_THAN",
                5
            ]
        ],
        "DateOfBirth": [
            "INVALID_RANGE"
        ]
    }
}
```

# 3.5. Authentication Headers

DFX tokens are serialized JWT tokens and are passed to the API server via the
"Authorization" header value. A basic structured request would look like this:

```Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...```

Organizations are provided with License Keys that can be exchanged for API
tokens by calling
<a href="/#reference/0/organizations/register-license">Register License</a>
endpoint.

## 3.5.1 More details and best practices

* Since tokens represent authentication information, please make sure to **store
them securely** - typically in some form of secure storage.

* Some License Keys have a limited number of allowed active Devices. If you need
to use your License on a different device, make sure to unregister your current
device first by calling the
<a href="/#reference/0/organizations/unregister-license">Organizations UnregisterLicense</a>
endpoint.

* The response to Organizations RegisterLicense contains a RoleID for the
license - if it is SDK_DEVICE, then obtaining a user token is mandatory.

* Tokens may expire. To ensure that a token is valid, you can call the
<a href="/#reference/0/general/verify-token">General VerifyToken</a> endpoint.
If the ActiveLicense field in the response is false or if the API returns one of
the following errors: `INVALID_TOKEN`, `LICENSE_EXPIRED`, `INACTIVE_LICENSE` or
`INACTIVE_DEVICE`, then the client must re-register the license.

* Please use the <a href="/#reference/0/auths/renew">Auths.Renew</a> endpoint
refresh your token.

# 4. Tokens

The DFX API is built around token authentication using JSON Web Tokens. Each
token is of variable size and comes serialized with key information pertaining
to the current access request.

All tokens are mapped against an internal policy manager that specifies what
access levels it has. The token policies control every access to the API.


## 4.1. Device Tokens

A device token usually represents a single device, such as the Anura
application. A device token is permanent and provides access to endpoints that
allow for device-specific feature facilities i.e. device check-in. Obtaining a
Device token is mandatory for any Measurement related activities.

Device Token is obtained by
<a href="/#reference/0/organizations/register-license">registering license.</a>

## 4.2. User Tokens

User tokens provide access to all libraries that are not `Measurements`.

User Token is obtained by logging in:
<a href="/#reference/0/users/login">Method 1</a>,
<a href="/#reference/0/organizations/login">Method 2</a>.

To take Measurements associated with your User account - login using
**Method 1** and submit the obtained `Token` for authentication.


## General [/]

### Status [GET /status]

An endpoint that propagates the current API health status and other information.
This can be used during an apps initial boot process to determine the
accessibility of the API and propagate a general status message to users.
Possible `Status` codes include:

| Status Message | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ACTIVE         | Online and fully operational                    |
| MAINTENANCE    | Offline for maintenance                         |
| ERROR          | Offline due to an error                         |
| LATENCY        | API is experience latency or a general slowdown |

Also present in the response are `Region` - the location of the API by cluster
and `AllowAnonymous` - a boolean, which when `false` means that user login (and
thus a user token) is *required* for making measurements.

Enables 2FA for logged in user using an MFASecret (created by `/users/mfa/secret` endpoint)
and MFAToken (derived from MFASecret by scanning a QR code by Google Authenticator or compatible app).

This is the second of two API calls needed to configure 2FA for a user.

The complete workflow would be
as follows:

1. Logged in user calls `/users/mfa/enable` and stores `secretBase32Encoded` and
`qrcode` properties.

2. User scans `qrcode` by 2FA token generation app.

3. User POSTs `secretBase32Encoded` as `MFASecret` and 2FA app temporary token
as `MFAToken` to `/users/mfa/enable` endpoint.

## Measurements [/measurements]

Measurements are individual one-time captures of blood flow data. A single
measurement record could represent multiple models of data analysis,
hence this data structure supports lookup parameters to filter them.

For consumers using the WebSocket transport method, extra options for streaming
live results are available. The detailed explanation of streaming implementation
will be added later.

**Note:**: A valid License is required in order to create Measurements and
submit data chunks for processing. Please make sure to call
<a href="/#reference/0/organizations/register-license">Register License</a>
endpoint first to receive a *Device Token* that grants access to these
functions. Next, in order to have your user information associated with the
measurements, you can use <a href="/#reference/0/users/login">User Login</a>
endpoint to obtain a *User Token*, which can be used to take Measurements as
well.

**Important:**: If your License Type is `SDK_DEVICE`, you must login and obtain
a User Token as this License Type only allows to perform a login operation.

### Create [POST /measurements]

Begins a new data capture session and returns a measurement ID property, which
should be referenced for adding data chunks and retreiving results.

**Resolution:** currently can be either 0 or 100.
(default is 100)

- 100 means the result set will have 100% of the original size
- 0 returns 1 value per signal
- Based on License policy PartnerID is mandatory or optional.


+ Request (application/json)

    + Headers

            Authorization: Bearer <api token>

    + Body

            {
                "StudyID": "7ab8bee7-808c-4123-9811-e385adb8c77d",
                "Resolution": 100,
                "UserProfileID": "Profile`s UUID (optional)",
                "PartnerID": "<partnerID> (optional or mandatory depending on license policy)"
            }

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "ID": "7ab8bee7-808c-4123-9811-e385adb8c77d"
        }

### Add Data [POST /measurements/{MeasurementID}/data]

Adds collected blood-flow data to a specific measurement. Upon submitting a
chunk of data, the API will return a `MeasurementDataID` value representing the
received chunk.  Data must be sent to the server in the order produced by the
DFX SDK. If a chunk it sent out of order, the server will return an error.
Please ensure that new chunks are only sent after the server responds with a
`MeasurementDataID`.

Submitting measurements has three stages: a) starting, b) measurement body, c)
closing a measurement. Each of these phases have the same payload structure
however a different `Action` flag is to be sent with each request and must
follow the `CHUNK::ACTION` format.

| Measurement Actions | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FIRST::PROCESS`    | Start a new measurement (drop any existing), Process results |
| `FIRST::IGNORE`     | Start a new measurement (drop any existing), Do not process  |
| `CHUNK::PROCESS`    | Arbitrary block of TOI data and process results              |
| `CHUNK::IGNORE`     | Arbitrary block of TOI data and do not process results       |
| `LAST::PROCESS`     | Finish a measurement cycle and process results               |
| `LAST::IGNORE`      | Finish a measurement cycle and do not process                |


`Payload` is binary data that can currently only be obtained by using our SDK.

For both the REST and WebSocket transports, the `Payload` (binary content)
field must be **base64-encoded**.

**Note:**: This endpoint is a subject to request throttling, you must not submit
more data than can be obtained in real time. i.e., do not send more than five
seconds of chunk data over the course of five seconds of real time.

Response Error Codes Explanation:

- "RATE_LIMIT": You have sent too many chunks in a given time period. See the
Note above.
- "MEASUREMENT_CLOSED": Requested Measurement is already finished. You need to
create a new Measurement.
- "MISALIGNED_CHUNK": Chunk Order was mismatched. i.e., ChunkOrder 2 was sent
before ChunkOrder 1.
- "INVALID_MEASUREMENT": Requested Measurement ID was not found.
- "UNPACKER_RPC_ERROR": Payload validation has been failed. Reason(s) will be
provided in error message.

+ Parameters
    + MeasurementID: Measurement UUID to add data to.

*Note*

`PasswordRequireCharacterClasses` works independently from
`PasswordRequireUppercase`, `PasswordRequireLowercase`, `PasswordRequireDigits`
and `PasswordRequireSpecial`. `PasswordRequireCharacterClasses` requires just
the number of character types without focusing at the character types
themselves; e.g. if two character classes are required, passwords made of
lower and upper case characters (`aaAA`), or digits and special (`00##`) will
be accepted.

Combining `PasswordRequireCharacterClasses` with `PasswordRequire*` properties
allows setting more complex rules. e.g., requiring 3 character classes along
with `PasswordRequireSpecial` forces passwords to include at least three
character types, one of which must be _special_.

`LimitLoginAttemptsCountPerWindow` and `LimitLoginAttemptsWindowDurationSeconds`
effectively allows setting login rate limiting. e.g., values 10 and 3600
respectively would set the limit on number of unsuccessful login attempts to 10
within one hour. Exceeding this limit would result in a HTTP 429 response.

`SessionMaxDurationSeconds` and `SessionIdleDurationSeconds` control the expiry
of JWT tokens.

This call requires DFX\_ORG\_ADMIN level permissions.

### Register License [POST /organizations/licenses]

Allows consumers to exchange a license key for a device token.

This endpoint is accessible publically to all consuming clients. License keys
are mapped against an organization. Upon submitting a registration key and
relevant information associated with the device to be registered, DFX API will
respond with a referencing DeviceID and a token for future device-specific API
requests. The resulting token is a _Device Token_.

The longevity and allowed origins of the token can be controlled by
`TokenExpiresIn` and `TokenSubject` optional parameters. `TokenExpiresIn`
specifies token validity duration in seconds. Effective duration will be
calculated as a minimum of `TokenExpiresIn`, license `Expiration` date and
organization's `SessionMaxDurationseconds`; i.e., this parameter can only be
used to further reduce token's lifespan.

`TokenSubject` locks the host which is allowed to use the token for its
communication with DeepAffex. When set, the server will compare the token value
with HTTP request's `Referer` header and reject the request if those don't
match.

**Note:** Please make sure to store the obtained token locally as most
Licenses (e.g. Trial) allow for a limited number of registered Devices. To
unregister a Device and get back one license, call the
<a href="/#reference/0/organizations/unregister-license">Unregister License</a>
endpoint with your `Device Token`.
